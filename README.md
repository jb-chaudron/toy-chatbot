# The Project

- Toy project to get my hands down to some LLM based chatbot, especially some RAGS

## The files

1. Walkthrough : A file handeling most of the chat functions
2. Embedding finetuning : Is aiming to retrain the LLM for the specific purpose of our input corpora
3. Question Answer generator : Is a file aiming to let our LLM produce itself pairs of question/answer which will be used for the embedding finetuning. We have to define careful prompt to assure ourselves the quality of the questions generated
4. Interactif.ipynb : Is a notebook allowing one to play around with the chatbot
